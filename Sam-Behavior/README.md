# Task description

For each trial, wait 5 sec (gray screen), then present one visual stimulus or one auditory stimulus chosen randomly from a set of a total of 4 stimuli (e.g. vertical grating, horizontal grating, 6 kHz tone, or 10 kHz tone) for 0.5 sec. One of the 4 stimuli is designated as the "go" stimulus for the entire session. If the mouse licks between 0.1-1 sec after onset of the go stimulus, deliver water. If the mouse licks during this same time window after onset of one of the other 3 stimuli, play white noise and turn the screen black for 3 sec. If the mouse does not lick during the response window, do nothing. Now start the next trial (5 sec gray screen, followed by a randomly chosen stimuli).
